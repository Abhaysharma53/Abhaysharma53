## 👋 Hi, I’m Abhay Sharma
I’m a Data Scientist who thrives at the intersection of data, logic, and impact.
I enjoy solving real-world problems by combining analytical thinking, statistical rigor, and practical automation.

🔍 Skilled in:

Extracting meaningful insights from messy data

Designing scalable workflows for experimentation

Communicating complex findings with clarity

🧠 My interests span Machine Learning, NLP, Causal Inference and Time Series Analysis, with a growing focus on building robust systems that are not just accurate—but also explainable and actionable.

Always learning, always iterating. Let's build things that make sense and make a difference.
